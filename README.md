# CramPlan

UNIHACK Hackathon Project - A personalized study assistant that generates customized study plans based on your understanding.

## Overview

CramPlan is a comprehensive learning platform that helps students create personalized study plans based on their understanding of various subjects. The application uses AI to generate study topics, create quizzes, evaluate understanding, and produce detailed study content tailored to the user's needs.

## Features

- **Topic Generation**: Generate study topics based on a subject
- **Quiz Generation**: Create quizzes to test your understanding
- **Understanding Evaluation**: Evaluate your understanding based on quiz responses
- **Content Generation**: Generate detailed study content based on your understanding
- **PDF Generation**: Export your study materials as beautifully formatted PDFs
- **Voice Interaction**: Interact with the platform using voice commands (in development)

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:

### Backend (agent_backend)

The backend is built with FastAPI and provides the core functionality of the application:

- Topic generation using AI
- Quiz creation and evaluation
- Content generation based on understanding
- PDF generation and export

Key files:

- `api.py`: Main API endpoints
- `llm_main.py`: AI agents for different tasks
- `pdf_generator.py`: PDF generation utilities
- `env_setup.py`: Environment setup utilities

### Frontend (cramplan_frontend)

The frontend is built with Next.js and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application:

- Home page for subject input
- Assessment page for quiz taking
- Study plan page for viewing generated content
- Upload page for importing existing materials

Key directories:

- `app/`: Main application pages
- `components/`: Reusable UI components
- `styles/`: CSS and styling
- `lib/`: Utility functions and API clients

### Voice Component (cramplan_voice)

The voice component is a separate module that enables voice interaction with the platform (currently in development):

- Voice command recognition
- Voice response generation
- Integration with the main application

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `/generate-topics`: Generate study topics based on a subject
- `/generate-quiz`: Generate a quiz based on topics
- `/evaluate-quiz`: Evaluate understanding based on quiz responses
- `/curate-topics`: Curate topics based on understanding
- `/generate-content`: Generate detailed study content
- `/complete-flow`: Run the complete flow from topic generation to content generation
- `/generate-pdf-from-content`: Generate a PDF from content
- `/generate-pdf-from-file`: Generate a PDF from a markdown file
- `/generate-pdf-from-text`: Generate a PDF from markdown text
- `/complete-flow-with-pdf`: Run the complete flow and return the result as a PDF
- `/health`: Health check endpoint

## PDF Generation

CramPlan supports exporting your study materials as PDF documents. This feature allows you to:

- Generate PDFs from content generated by the application
- Convert markdown files to PDFs
- Convert markdown text to PDFs
- Run a complete flow and get the result as a PDF

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the PDF generation functionality, see [PDF Generation Documentation](agent_backend/README_PDF.md).

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```
4. Set up WeasyPrint for PDF generation (macOS):
   ```bash
